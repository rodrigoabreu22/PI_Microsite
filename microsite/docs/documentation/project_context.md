# Project Context

### Context

#### Networks
Networks have evolved significantly from traditional static infrastructures to more dynamic, intelligent, and adaptive systems.​

5G and Beyond-5G networks must:​
- handle vast amounts of data.​
- support a diverse range of applications. ​
- ensure high reliability and low latency. ​

**Goal**: Achieve self-managing networks, where human intervention is minimized.​

#### NWDAF
Network Data Analytics Function​ are being developed with the goal of:
- collecting and analyzing network data​
- provide predictions for network optimization​

Has three main aspects:​

- Data Collection​
- Analytics Processing​
- Analytics Exposure​

**Goal**: Automating the 5G network with machine learning and data analytics

#### MLOPs Pipeline

- MLOps is an extension of DevOps, specifically adapted for machine learning workflows.​
- End-to-end machine learning development process.​
- Aims to unify the release cycle for machine learning.​
- Enables the application of agile principles to machine learning projects.​


### Problem
- Increase in data consuming slows the network.​
- Utilization spikes, can compromise network QoS.​
- Technical problems (latency, packet loss) cause data transmission delays.​
- Simply setting up more network and maintaining it is expensive.​

​
### Goals
- Implement a Data Pipeline for Network Intelligence.​
- Develop and Integrate Machine Learning Models.​
- Automate Network Optimization & Decision-Making.​
- Implementation of a scalable and modular MLOps pipeline that works as a NWDAF when integrated with a 5G network.​
- Ensure Compliance with 3GPP Standards. ​
- Attempt Integration with existing 5G Core Network Components.​
- Ensure seamless Communication Between Services within the pipeline.​
- Evaluate System Performance under several Network Conditions.​
- Provide a User-Friendly Deployment and Monitoring System.​


### Expected Results
- A modular and scalable MLOps pipeline that when integrated with a 5G network works as a base for a NWDAF.​
- A NWDAF-like architecture that can be deployed in any 3GPP-compliant network. ​
- Comprehensive validation of NWDAF-like architecture performance through real-world use cases in a 5G environment.
