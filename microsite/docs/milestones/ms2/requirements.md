# Requirements
Here is presented the requirements elicitation methods, functional requirements (divided by the respective components) and non-functional requirements.

## Requirements Elicitation
This process was divided into four parts. The first part consisted of investigating the project's theme and its context to obtain maximum knowledge in the field of **telecommunications and 5G networks**. Next, we had to evaluate the most correct way to relate this to the **data engineering and Machine Learning** part of the project. After that, we explored the **state of the art**, evaluating other research works in the area and gathering important information for **discussion among us**.
