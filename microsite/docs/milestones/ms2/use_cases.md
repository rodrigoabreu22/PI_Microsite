# Use Cases & Scenario
Here you can find the project Use Cases and a Scenario related to the use case we are going to implement.

## Actors
Our project aims for two actors:
- Newtork/service provider.
- Client (service provider client).

>The client doesn't actively participate in the use cases but it is directly influenced by them.

## Use Cases

### Use Case to implement: Anomaly detection and fault prediction
Detect abnormal patterns in network behavior, predict failures before they occur, and provide actionable recommendations to prevent service disruptions. 

#### Related Scenario
A smart manufacturing facility relies on thousands of IoT sensors to control and monitor operations. These include environmental sensors that track temperature, humidity, and air quality to ensure product quality. 

Suddenly, the system detects a spike in data traffic from temperature sensors, which could indicate a malfunction or cyberattack. If left unchecked, this anomaly could lead to equipment damage or pose safety risks to nearby workers. 

In response, the network monitoring system triggers alerts, prompting real-time actions such as isolating abnormal traffic, and reallocating network resources to ensure continued safe and efficient operations.
